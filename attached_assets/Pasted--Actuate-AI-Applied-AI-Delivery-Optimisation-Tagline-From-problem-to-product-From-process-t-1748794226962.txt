‚öôÔ∏è Actuate AI - Applied AI Delivery & Optimisation

Tagline: From problem to product. From process to intelligence.

Positioning Statement:
Actuate AI is your AI-native execution engine - a modular service suite built to embed applicable, governed AI across the enterprise. Whether you're operationalising an AI strategy or solving a specific business process challenge, Actuate delivers componentised services that work within the broader IntentOps governance layer or stand alone as tactical interventions.

"Actuate combines the cognition of your people with the execution power of AI. It's not about replacing work - it's about delivering the future faster, with the people who know what matters."

"AI is only useful if it moves the needle. Actuate brings the tools, the talent, and the tempo to get real outcomes shipped - not just imagined."

From PRD-to-prompt, prototype-to-product

From manual bottlenecks to AI-enhanced flow

From uncontrolled experimentation to governed execution

Actuate ensures AI doesn‚Äôt just land-it works.

üéØ What Actuate Solves

Organisations struggle to move beyond GenAI prototypes

Delivery teams face tool fragmentation, hallucination risk, and misaligned scope

Legacy operations continue to create drag despite AI investments

Process automation lacks context, accuracy, and resilience

Actuate solves this by combining:

Strategy-to-systems alignment

Outcome-first GenAI delivery

Enterprise-safe prompt engineering

Intelligent BPM overlay

üöÄ Actuate Services

1. AI Opportunity Discovery & Use Case Design

Executive facilitation, PRD design support

Marketplace mapping across LLMs, APIs, frameworks

Feasibility scoping, technical risk, hallucination analysis

Early ROI, delivery impact, and risk indicators

What makes it different:
Grounded in IntentOps governance. Everything begins with outcome and traceability.

2. AI-Native Product & Prototype Development

Build custom copilots, agents, AI-native workflows

RAG pipelines, tool/agent chaining, UX-integrated prompts

Context-aware response models with fallback & testing

Early telemetry, feedback loops, hallucination suppression

What makes it different:
Outcome loops are embedded from sprint zero. It‚Äôs not just working code - it‚Äôs governable, trackable, accountable product.

3. Process Optimisation (BPO+)

Identify high-friction, manual, or error-prone workflows

Pair GenAI + RPA + human-in-loop for true cognitive automation

Handle semi-structured data, summarisation, routing, enrichment

Multilingual pipelines with quality thresholds (98%+)

What makes it different:
Based on real-world results from scaled automation delivery (abstracted from NashTech).

4. Prompt Engineering as a Service

Refine PRDs into prompt libraries

Model-agnostic design (Claude, GPT, Mistral, open models)

Safe system prompts, structured guardrails, persona switching

Test cases, performance tuning, reusable prompt libraries

What makes it different:
PromptOps discipline built into delivery. We treat this like product dev, not copywriting.

5. AI-Augmented Delivery & Ops

Project ops copilots, velocity forecasting, delivery retros

System telemetry fed back into IntentOps governance

AI-enhanced feedback loops, risk analysis, value decay alerts

FlowOps patterns for unblocking delivery friction

What makes it different:
Uses SPACE and DORA frameworks as the delivery signal, not effort or burn-down.

6. Enterprise AI Operations (via strategic partners)

Large-scale data labelling, image enrichment, structured QA

Model performance monitoring, hallucination tracing, black-box detection

AI behaviour explainability frameworks

Integration with governance dashboards

What makes it different:
Our partners provide scale, but we control the model lifecycle and governance standards.
