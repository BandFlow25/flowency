‚öôÔ∏è Actuate AI - Applied AI Delivery and Optimisation

Tagline: From problem to product. From process to intelligence.

Positioning Statement:
Actuate AI is your AI-native execution engine - a modular service suite designed to deliver applied artificial intelligence across the enterprise. Whether you are automating a specific business process, experimenting with a GenAI prototype, or building production-ready tools, Actuate offers a flexible set of services that can be consumed independently or delivered as part of a larger transformation programme. All services operate within optional guardrails provided by IntentOps, ensuring quality, safety, and value alignment without requiring heavy upfront strategy work.

"Actuate combines the cognition of your people with the execution power of AI. It's not about replacing work - it's about delivering the future faster, with the people who know what matters."

"AI is only useful if it moves the needle. Actuate brings the tools, the talent, and the tempo to get real outcomes shipped - not just imagined."

From raw intent to production-ready prototypes

From manual bottlenecks to AI-enhanced flow

From uncontrolled experimentation to governed execution

Actuate ensures AI does not just land - it works.

üîç How Can Actuate Help You?

Actuate offers practical, outcome-led AI services that help you accelerate value, reduce friction, and embed intelligence where it matters. Every service is available as a discreet engagement or can be combined under a broader capability uplift programme with IntentOps.

Outcome-first GenAI delivery - rapidly design, build, and iterate production-grade features with measurable business value

Enterprise-safe prompt engineering - model-agnostic, governed, and reusable

Prototyping at speed - turn ideas into working demos quickly

Tool fragmentation - unify LLMs, APIs, and workflows under expert guidance

Reducing hallucination risk - prompt testing, guardrails, and fallback patterns

Legacy drag - intelligent automation that reduces or removes unnecessary layers of workflow

Process re-engineering and automation - optimise and rebuild business processes to improve speed, accuracy, and cost-efficiency

Whether you need to streamline a single process or build an internal AI capability, Actuate is built for flexibility.

üöÄ Actuate Service Lines

1. AI Strategy to Action

The problem: Organisations often face a disconnect between executive ambition, scattered experiments, and actual delivery. AI investments lack coordination, leading to duplication and cognitive debt.

What we offer: Structured definition and alignment of AI strategy with clear prioritisation, roadmap design, and governance-ready execution framing.

What you get:

Prioritised use case portfolio aligned to business value

Production-ready PRDs with integrated feasibility analysis

Tooling and model landscape matched to your context

Optional IntentOps support to track intent through to value

2. AI-Native Product and Prototype Development

The problem: You have a defined use case but need rapid, secure, and effective delivery of AI-native tools.

What we offer: Full-cycle product and prototype development, from intent framing to testable build, with embedded context and telemetry.

What you get:

Live features or high-fidelity prototypes ready for test or scale

UX-integrated LLM pipelines, agents, and orchestration

Testing, observability, and control measures built-in

IntentOps optional integration for traceable value loops

3. Intelligent Process Transformation

The problem: Your operations are encumbered by layers of legacy workflows, manual interventions, and nested processes that generate drag.

What we offer: Business process re-engineering and targeted automation using GenAI, RPA, and human-in-the-loop design to remove waste and improve resilience.

What you get:

Refactored process maps with automation targets

GenAI-enhanced automation flows with structured output

Improved speed, quality, compliance, and customer outcomes

Optional execution with delivery partners to scale rapidly

4. Prompt Engineering as a Service

The problem: Your LLM-based products lack consistency, reliability, or alignment to business goals.

What we offer: High-quality prompt design, tuning, testing, and lifecycle management, grounded in deep expertise and business context.

What you get:

Enterprise prompt libraries tailored to business intent

Persona switching, fallback logic, and response guardrails

Model-agnostic patterns with performance monitoring

Integration into AI features or operations, with IntentOps if required

5. Operational Decision Support with AI

The problem: Delivery leaders lack real-time insight into blockers, waste, and drift. Traditional metrics are lagging and blind to value.

What we offer: AI-augmented observability, surfacing friction points, risk patterns, and waste hotspots to inform faster, better decisions.

What you get:

Delivery copilots and dashboards highlighting where value is stuck

Quantified blocker, discard, and delay costs

Visual intent-to-outcome maps for portfolio and product flow

Seamless alignment with IntentOps for governed execution

üîë Differentiators

Feature

Why It Matters

Intent-aligned from day one

Not just building - aligning to enterprise objectives

Modular services, fast value

Start small, scale confidently

Prompt Engineering as a service

Structured, testable, reusable

GenAI + RPA + HITL fusion

Real-world automation, not lab experiments

Feedback and governance embedded

No AI product is complete without oversight

Built to scale across teams and tools

Designed for reuse, integration, and control

üß† How Actuate and IntentOps Work Together

Actuate delivers outcomes. IntentOps ensures they are strategic, governed, and traceable.

Every Actuate engagement can operate standalone. But when paired with IntentOps, value becomes visible across the lifecycle:

IntentOps defines the strategic north star

Actuate operationalises it with tangible AI execution

Outcomes are measured, waste is flagged, and telemetry feeds back

Together, they form a continuous delivery and governance loop for AI-native enterprises.
