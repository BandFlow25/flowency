3-Level Model: From Marketing Layer to Consulting Depth
Level 1: Web UI (Landing Page – Marketing Layer)
Purpose: Get attention. Make buyers believe you solve a real problem and want to talk.

Format:

5 cards (one per service line)

Each has:

A clear problem (1 line)

What we do (1 sentence, max 15 words)

What they get (1 result)

One line differentiator (optional hover/reveal)

Example (for web tile):

🔄 Intelligent Process Transformation
“Your workflows are full of manual handoffs and drag.”
Redesign and automate broken processes using GenAI, RPA and smart orchestration.
Outcome: Reduced effort, faster outcomes, and higher operational resilience.

This gives people a “yes, that’s me” moment and a reason to scroll deeper or engage.

Level 2: Expandable Detail (Web App / Modal / Drawer)
Purpose: Engage interested buyers with enough substance to confirm you're credible and differentiated.

Each service expands into:

2–3 sentences on what it is

3 bullet outcomes

1 visual differentiator

CTA: “Get the service brief” or “Talk to us about this”

This is where you can use the “Problem → Offer → Result” structure, but in compressed format. This draws from your current document and translates well.

Level 3: Consultant-Facing Collateral (PDF / Playbook / Pitch Deck)
Purpose: Back up the website promise with full structure behind each offer — for clients, proposals, procurement, delivery onboarding.

This is exactly what your current canvas document is — and it’s perfect. We should not try to cram this into the website directly. Instead, we reference it via gated downloads or internal links.

💡 My Strategic Recommendation
Web Page Layer
Replace your current “solutionsData” structure with a stripped-down set of five tiles based on Level 1 above.

Interactive Reveal
If clicked, show the Level 2 structure using a modal, drawer, or smooth accordion — pulling from your refined copy.

CTA-Driven Access to Full Detail
Every deep-dive has a link to the “Service Overview PDF” or “Talk to a Consultant” — backed by the canvas doc.
