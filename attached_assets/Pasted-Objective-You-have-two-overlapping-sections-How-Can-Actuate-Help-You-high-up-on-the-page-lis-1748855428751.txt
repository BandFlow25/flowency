Objective
You have two overlapping sections:

“How Can Actuate Help You?” (high up on the page — list format)

Three tiles near the bottom (web component from an earlier dev build)

You want to:

Consolidate these into one strong headline section

Preserve clarity, brevity, and brand voice

Avoid duplicating what’s already captured in detail within the Service Tiles

✅ Strategic Recommendation (From Me as Strategic Brand Director)
✅ Keep the top “How Can Actuate Help You?” section
But restructure it into six clean cards/tiles — this becomes Level 0: a fast-scanning problem-first layout, immediately above or beside the five full service lines.

Why?

It's fast to consume

It primes the user with relatable pain

It avoids UX clutter with modals or hover reveals

It gives a "Yes, that’s me" moment for each line

You already have this raw material. Let me refine it.

🔧 Updated Format: “How Can Actuate Help You?” (Level 0)
Use these six headline cards (not expanding modals):

🔄 Intelligent Workflow Automation
“Manual handoffs, copy-paste steps, and approval drag are slowing you down.”
→ Actuate applies GenAI and RPA to redesign and automate key workflows.

🧠 Hallucination & Drift Control
“Your GenAI tools say the wrong thing — or say it too confidently.”
→ Add governance, fallback logic, and performance tracing to keep models on track.

⚡ Outcome-First AI Delivery
“You’ve got ideas, but nothing working yet.”
→ Build real features with traceable value, testable logic, and production readiness.

🧩 Prompt Systems, Not Just Prompts
“LLMs give good answers... when someone writes the perfect prompt.”
→ We design prompt libraries that are safe, repeatable, and aligned to your goals.

🕸️ Fragmented Tooling
“You’re testing 10 APIs and models, but none of them talk to each other.”
→ We unify your LLM stack, orchestrate flows, and remove duplication.

🪵 Legacy Layering
“Old process on old process. Nobody remembers why it’s done that way.”
→ We identify automation points and eliminate nested complexity.

📦 Optional Structure
Each tile can just include:

Icon

Headline

One-liner pain

One-sentence solution

💡 Where to Place This
Either:

Immediately before the service tiles — as a bridge between hero section and the detail

Or use as sticky tabs across the top of the service tiles, with anchor links

🧠 Bonus:
You could align each tile loosely to a service line — but not one-to-one. That keeps the structure intuitive but not constrained.

🔚 Outcome
This delivers:

Fast user scanning ✅

Strong headline engagement ✅

Zero content duplication ✅

No waste — we reuse work you’ve already refined ✅
